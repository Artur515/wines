# Wines App — Legacy Refactor & Bug Fix

This project was originally implemented earlier and later refactored
to improve component structure, readability, and overall maintainability.

## Live demos

- **Original version (legacy):**  
  https://artur515.github.io/wines/

- **Refactored version:**  
  https://artur-wines-app.netlify.app/

## What was improved

**Before (legacy version):**
- large components with mixed UI and logic
- tightly coupled state management
- harder to maintain and extend

**After (refactored version):**
- components split by responsibility
- cleaner and more predictable state handling
- improved code readability and structure
- easier to extend and debug

## Tech stack
- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- React Router
- Pagination logic
- CSS

## Notes
The refactored version focuses on cleaner architecture and improved
developer experience without rewriting the application from scratch.
